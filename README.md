# TextExtraction_from_multimedia

# ABSTRACT

Text extraction is one of the key tasks in document image analysis. Automatic text extraction without characters recognition capabilities is to extract regions that just contain text. The text extraction process includes detection, localization, segmentation, and enhancement of the text from the given input image. In this paper, we present a comparative study and performance evaluation of various text extraction techniques. 
Keywords: Text Detection, Text Extraction, QR generation, Speech to text. 

# INTRODUCTION

Text extraction from an image is a challenging problem because the image contains text due to different sizes, styles, orientations, alignment, low contrast, and noise and has a complex background structure. This extracted text contains only black text on white background, i.e. it can be recognized by any recognition system. Extracting text from an image or video includes different applications like document processing, image indexing, video content summary, video retrieval, video understanding, etc
